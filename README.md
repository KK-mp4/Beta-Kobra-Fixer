# Beta Kobra Fixer
## Filter for MCEdit 1.0 for fixing Kobras for Minecraft Java Edition Beta 1.7 - 1.4.7

Minecraft now has Kobras in the very first version pistons got added, you can watch this video for more information - [How to Generate a Spawner in MCJE Beta 1.7](https://youtu.be/G6L-5owxID4).  
Kimo made a mod that allowes to constantly power detector rails (as if they always have minecarts on them), this greatly speeds up the development of Kobras, since we don't need to worry about minecarts. This MCEdit filter is made so you can convert builds made with such mod into Kobras that work in vanilla single player.

## What this filter does?
It does two things:
- places a minecart above each detector rail;
- changes data value of all rails to 0, so there are no sloped rails.

## How to install
1. Download [32 bit MCEdit](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldenAgeMinecraft/comments/opfrb2/mcedit_for_beta/) and open mcedit.exe
2. Quick Load -> Select needed world -> Select an area -> Press **Filter** option in the bottom menu
